                                Ree identified which buttons to push and what words to say. DPS evaluated our daughter shortly after
                                meeting with her.
                                Prior to meeting Joo Ree we spent months running around in circles, sending emails and leaving
                                voicemails that were left
                                unanswered. I wish we had connected with Joo Ree sooner!”

                                “Provided the ‘white glove’ treatment from beginning to end”<br><br>
                                “JRC Partnerships provided comprehensive services to help determine the best school for my daughter’s
                                Kindergarten year.
                                From the initial consultation and questionnaire, I felt “held” and comforted knowing that Joo Ree would
                                take the time to
                                understand my daughter’s educational needs and also consider our family needs (e.g., commute, cost,
                                preferences of
                                public vs private school). She really seemed to “get” my daughter’s learning style and catered her
                                search to schools
                                that would be exactly right for her. Joo Ree’s preparedness and professionalism shone through to myself
                                and to school
                                staff. She attended every school tour and asked administration direct - sometimes hard - questions. They
                                responded
                                candidly, perhaps because they appreciated her demeanor and the research involved in knowing which
                                questions to ask.
                                <br><br>
                                What I appreciated most about Joo Ree was her candor with me. She clearly stated her professional
                                opinions, so that I
                                could make informed decisions. She respected my feedback and my own instincts about what might be a good
                                fit for our
                                family. Joo Ree gently nudged me away from a school that I loved, but was not a match for my daughter’s
                                learning style
                                and needs. JRC Partnerships provided the “white glove” treatment from beginning to end, and we could not
                                be happier with
                                my daughter’s final placement!”

                                I have had the absolute pleasure of working with Joo Ree since my 
                                early days as a clinical psychologist. We first worked together 
                                when she was the school psychologist at the Montessori School of 
                                Denver, and I found her to be one of the most collaborative individuals 
                                I came across in my work with various schools and providers. 
                                <br><br>
                                I always 
                                appreciated Joo Ree's perspectives on students and the systems they 
                                were in, and her efforts to enact change on multiple levels, not just 
                                with the individual. She has a real gift of holding empathy and understanding 
                                for challenging situations, but also guiding families and educators toward solutions. 
                                When she shifted away from work in the schools, Joo Ree remained a wonderful 
                                presence in my professional life. I have so much trust in her knowledge and lens, 
                                and her passion for this work is evident in everything she undertakes. 
                                <br><br>
                                I'm excited for this next chapter in her professional journey, and see her as an incredible 
                                asset in this field!

                                “Through the years I have referred countless clients to JRC Partnerships
                                and every single one of them has taken the time to come back to us and say
                                that the experience was enlightening and helpful. Here are just a few examples
                                of families I sent Joo Ree’s way:<br><br>
                
                                ● A family deciding whether to keep their child at the school they love or
                                move him to a different school that could better accommodate his learning needs.<br><br>
                
                                ● A family that needed data to determine whether the current school placement
                                was in fact honoring their IEP commitment.<br><br>
                
                                ● A family that received a thorough and well-written neuropsychological evaluation,
                                but were still confused by the results and how the findings would impact their child
                                on a day-to-day basis as well as at school. Joo Ree was able to break down the
                                evaluation in an easy-to-understand format.<br><br>
                
                                ● A family that needed to pull their child from private school due to medical needs
                                and needed input in how to manage curriculum while continuing his education through
                                home-schooling.<br><br>

                                I would highly recommend Joo Ree for your child's educational consulting needs. 
                                As an experienced and highly trained school psychologist, Joo Ree truly understands 
                                the needs of neurodiverse students and is able to quickly uncover what supports 
                                they need both in and outside of school to perform their best. Joo Ree also has 
                                in-depth knowledge of the school system, as well as private evaluation clinics in 
                                the metro-Denver area, and knows how to collaborate effectively with multidisciplinary 
                                teams. She is a wonderful resource for the community and a true leader in the field of 
                                educational psychology.
