                Joo Ree Chu is a School Psychologist with a wide breadth of professional experience. For over a decade she has worked in
                both public and private school settings to support children, their caregivers, teachers, and school leadership. She
                believes every parent is the expert of their child and wants the best for them. When it comes to educational matters,
                Joo Ree is committed to partnering with families to guide and support them through uncertainty and setbacks. Her work is
                driven by the principle that supportive and equitable learning environments result in better outcomes for all.
                <br><br>

                Joo Ree is the proud mother of two children who have attended both public and private schools. She understands the
                trials and tribulations of parenthood and what it means to take life one day (sometimes one hour!) at a time. She is a
                lifelong dancer, swimmer, and enjoys finding respite in nature. Joo Ree also enjoys traveling abroad to learn about
                different cultures and educational systems to broaden her professional perspective. JRC Partnerships is honored to
                redistribute 10% of all service fees to community-serving organizations in the U.S. and overseas.<br><br>

                            <span>“Provided the ‘white glove’ treatment from beginning to end”</span><br><br>
                            “JRC Partnerships provided comprehensive services to help determine the best school for my daughter’s
                            Kindergarten year.
                            From the initial consultation and questionnaire, I felt “held” and comforted knowing that Joo Ree would
                            take the time to
                            understand my daughter’s educational needs and also consider our family needs (e.g., commute, cost,
                            preferences of
                            public vs private school). She really seemed to “get” my daughter’s learning style and catered her
                            search to schools
                            that would be exactly right for her. Joo Ree’s preparedness and professionalism shone through to myself
                            and to school
                            staff. She attended every school tour and asked administration direct - sometimes hard - questions. They
                            responded
                            candidly, perhaps because they appreciated her demeanor and the research involved in knowing which
                            questions to ask.
                            <br><br>
                            What I appreciated most about Joo Ree was her candor with me. She clearly stated her professional
                            opinions, so that I
                            could make informed decisions. She respected my feedback and my own instincts about what might be a good
                            fit for our
                            family. Joo Ree gently nudged me away from a school that I loved, but was not a match for my daughter’s
                            learning style
                            and needs. JRC Partnerships provided the “white glove” treatment from beginning to end, and we could not
                            be happier with
                            my daughter’s final placement!”

                            I have had the absolute pleasure of working with Joo Ree since my 
                            early days as a clinical psychologist. We first worked together 
                            when she was the school psychologist at the Montessori School of 
                            Denver, and I found her to be one of the most collaborative individuals 
                            I came across in my work with various schools and providers. 
                            <br><br>
                            I always 
                            appreciated Joo Ree's perspectives on students and the systems they 
                            were in, and her efforts to enact change on multiple levels, not just 
                            with the individual. She has a real gift of holding empathy and understanding 
                            for challenging situations, but also guiding families and educators toward solutions. 
                            When she shifted away from work in the schools, Joo Ree remained a wonderful 
                            presence in my professional life. I have so much trust in her knowledge and lens, 
                            and her passion for this work is evident in everything she undertakes. 
                            <br><br>
                            I'm excited for this next chapter in her professional journey, and see her as an incredible 
                            asset in this field!

                            “Through the years I have referred countless clients to JRC Partnerships
                            and every single one of them has taken the time to come back to us and say
                            that the experience was enlightening and helpful. Here are just a few examples
                            of families I sent Joo Ree’s way:<br><br>
            
                            ● A family deciding whether to keep their child at the school they love or
                            move him to a different school that could better accommodate his learning needs.<br><br>
            
                            ● A family that needed data to determine whether the current school placement
                            was in fact honoring their IEP commitment.<br><br>
            
                            ● A family that received a thorough and well-written neuropsychological evaluation,
                            but were still confused by the results and how the findings would impact their child
                            on a day-to-day basis as well as at school. Joo Ree was able to break down the
                            evaluation in an easy-to-understand format.<br><br>
            
                            ● A family that needed to pull their child from private school due to medical needs
                            and needed input in how to manage curriculum while continuing his education through
                            home-schooling.<br><br>

                            I would highly recommend Joo Ree for your child's educational consulting needs. 
                            As an experienced and highly trained school psychologist, Joo Ree truly understands 
                            the needs of neurodiverse students and is able to quickly uncover what supports 
                            they need both in and outside of school to perform their best. Joo Ree also has 
                            in-depth knowledge of the school system, as well as private evaluation clinics in 
                            the metro-Denver area, and knows how to collaborate effectively with multidisciplinary 
                            teams. She is a wonderful resource for the community and a true leader in the field of
